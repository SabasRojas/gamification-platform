 * Description: As part of a 2-person team, I helped design and implement an interactive gamification website that integrated a MySQL database with a PHP/HTML front and back end. The system featured user and manager account management, dynamic content delivery, and interactive elements to engage users in a gamified experience. The project strengthened my understanding of database design, server-side logic, and full-stack web development workflows.
